# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    title: My Vision
    passage1: "In school, when I was a little boy, I already was different from my class mates. I was completely different and I always had the desire to inspire others. Seeing the bright eyes of my friends when they were building their sand castles was making me happy.\n\r And this wish to inspire others brought me to set up a concept allowing children, teenagers and adults to learn a language in a fast and sustainable way. It seems that my competitors only see the result of my work, the results of my students and are afraid to loose some part of the market. This is certainly justified but in fact the success belongs to my students. And somewhere inside of myself there still is this little boy happy to see the bright eyes around him.."
