# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    passage1: "Private customers want to be operational as fast as possible and use their new language competences in a sustainable way-"
    passage2: "Employees should be able to use the new language quickly in business."
    passage3: "The academia objective is to make students confident and well versed when preparing any professional mission. Learners are enabled to use the new language in a business environment right away. They become <b>rapidly operational</b> and thus <b>highly motivated</b>."
    passage4: "The content is designed to <b>prepare students quickly</b> and ensure that their skills remain effective, up-to-date, and on target. A variety of <b>on-the-job tools</b> help them succeed in any professional situation."
    passage5: "A wide range of on-the-job tools prepares students to communicate effectively in a business environment:"
    title2: "Here is the fitting language course for you!"
    title3: A customized language program.

    title: Vision
    passage1: "In school, when I was a little boy, I already was different from my class mates. I was completely different and I always had the desire to inspire others. Seeing the bright eyes of my friends when they were building their sand castles was making me happy.\n\r And this wish to inspire others brought me to set up a concept allowing children, teenagers and adults to learn a language in a fast and sustainable way. It seems that my competitors only see the result of my work, the results of my students and are afraid to loose some part of the market. This is certainly justified but in fact the success belongs to my students. And somewhere inside of myself there still is this little boy happy to see the bright eyes around him.."

    title: "Once upon a time... in a land where people speak many different languages"    
    passage1: 
      - "Behind everything, is a great story. Well... I'm not sure if for you this is a great story or not, but here it is."
      - "My name is Jean-Paul Piazzolla, I live in Luxembourg in the centre of Europe and like most people here I am fluent in several languages."  
      - "During my studies in psychology I used to be a teacher in primary education and now I am a professional trainer/teacher with 20+ years experience."
      - "In early 2000, I saw for the first time how languages are taught in a new way."
      - "Without grammar, without learning word power and without translation. Like many people I was very impressed, but like many people, I realized immediately the lack of sustainable learning with this method claiming you can learn different languages the same way."  
      - "For years I researched, configured, set up and learned any new teaching method I could find. It turns out there are many, but only a few that met my simple criteria:"
    criteria_title: "Criteria"
    criteria_list:
      - Easy to use for the student
      - Powerful
      - Sustainable
    passage2: 
      - "So, after much consideration, I decided to start my own teaching method. Sounds easy right? However, as I learned, I had many challenges awaiting me."
    challenges_title: "Challenges"
    challenges_list:
      - I barely knew anything about marketing to attract new clients
      - Almost all methods that I found were based on frontal teaching. It is well known that frontal teaching is often prefered over other teaching methods, however it is unlikely to get students to think and act in an independent way.
      - I had to develop an action-oriented method, taking care of each students individual needs to develop his skills and abilities in a sustainable way.
    passage3:
      - "I decided it would be an interesting challenge and it was worth attempting. The constant contact with my students is showing me every day that they are on the right track with their new language."
      - "This allows me to document my key decisions, meet many interesting people, and most importantly, it gives me a direct feedback loop with the community I am serving."
  pedagogy:
    title: "Pedagogy"
    passage1: "Hands-on training is an approach enabling you to learn a new language in a fast and sustainable way. Hands-on training is:"
    bullet1: "Holistic: This refers to each learner's overall personality. Learning has cognitive, emotional and practical dimensions, during the learning process thoughts and actions are interconnected. The contents are always put in a meaningful context."
    bullet2: "Centered on active student: During the planning, implementation and assessment the the learner's experience and interests are taken in consideration. This enables learners to independently acquire knowledge to solve problems and make decisions on assessments."
    bullet3: "Centered on the content: The focus of the teaching process is agreed between the teacher and the students and during learning worked out by the whole group."
    bullet4: "Process-oriented: The joint action is paramount. Learners think, plan, discuss, make and assess  decisions as a team (learning by doing)."

    text1: "The first module provides students  with elementary grammar rules. So they can easily gain basic  knowledge  to face standard situations in a restaurant and while traveling. To find something to eat or a night accommodation won't be difficult either."

    text5: "You are fluent in every situation and able to react correct and quickly to complicated things. During professional meetings you become a confident leader and prove your point of view in conflict  situations.  At this point you understand how to handle some registered language – it could be written expression,  colloquial language or nice idiomatic expression ­ you are able to express yourself correctly."
    subtitle6: "C2 Mastery – all you need to know"
    text6: "You can understand complicated discussion in every situation without a problem. At any time you are  communicating in everyday life and in business with self confidence and have pleasure to participate in controvertible discussions."
